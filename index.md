# Short Description
Social media and other forms of online communication have triggered
the emergence of new forms of written texts and increase the volume of
multilingual user generated content. Making these unlimited streams of
non-canonical texts automatically understandable and actionable opens
new scientific and social challenges. This is the main focus of the
ParSiTi project.
